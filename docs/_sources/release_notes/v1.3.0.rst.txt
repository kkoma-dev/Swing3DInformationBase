API Improvements
-----------------
- Improved 3D Scan speed
    Optimized the ``Capture3D()`` function to improve 3D scan speed. Based on the default setting of Exposure Time (467),
    3D scans now complete in less than a second.

    .. note::
        The 3D Scan speed depends on the set ``Exposure Time``.

- Troubleshooting unexpected outages while using the API
    Handled a number of exceptions that can occur while using the API, resolving the issue of unexpected hangs.
    This has greatly improved the overall reliability of the API.

- Rename ``findPatternTransform()`` to ``CalculateTransformMatrixFromChessPattern()``
    Renamed the ``findPatternTransform()`` function to ``CalculateTransformMatrixFromChessPattern()``.
    This change more clearly reflects the function's functionality
    and makes it easier for users to understand its purpose.

- Separate into functional classes and namespaces
    To improve code structure, we've made features into classes and separated them into associated namespaces. The main classes and namespaces are as follows

    - DeviceInfo
        - ModelName
        - VendorName
        - ManufacturerInfo
        - FirmwareVersion
        - MCUFirmwareVersion
        - Temperature

    - NetworkSettings
        - MACAddress
        - CurrentIPConfiguration(DHCP/Static)
        - CurrentIPAddress
        - CurrentSubnetMask
        - CurrentDefaultGateway
        - PersistentIPAddress
        - PersistentSubnetMask
        - PersistentDefaultGateway

    - DeviceSettings
        - OutputMode(None/2D/3D)
        - ExposureTime
        - PeakThreshold
        - LaserPower
        - LaserState(On/Off)


API New Features
----------------
- Added ``SetOutputMode()`` function
    Added the function to set the output mode (2D/3D).
    This function replaces the ``Initialize2DConfig()`` and ``Initialize3DConfig()`` functions.

    .. note::
        When setting the Output Mode, settings saved via ``SaveDeviceSettings()`` are loaded with
        those values if they exist, otherwise the default settings are applied.

- Added ``GetOutputMode()`` function
    Added the function to check the current output mode.

- Added ``SaveDeviceSettings()`` and ``LoadDeviceSettings()`` functions
    Added the ability to save and load DeviceSettings (Exposure Time, Peak Threshold, Laser Power).
    Settings are saved based on the current output mode (2D/3D) of swing3D.

- Added ``GenerateZMap()`` function
    Added the function to the ``PointCloud`` class to generate 2D Z maps of different resolutions based on a point cloud.

- Added ``IsConnected()`` function
    Added the function to check whether swing3D is connected or not.

- Added ``UpdateFirmware()`` function
    Added the function to update swing3D's firmware.

- Added ``SetDeviceDisconnectEventCallback()`` function
    Added the function to set a callback function to act when a swing3D is disconnected.

- Added ``CreateTransformMatrix()`` function
    Added the function to compute a transform matrix that aligns a plane defined by three 3D points to the z-axis.
