API New Features
---------------------
- Added ``Utils::CreateTransformMatrix`` function
    Creates a ``transformation matrix`` to align a plane defined by three points with the Z-axis.

- Added ``PointCloud::SaveToCSV`` function
    Saves 3D data to a ``.csv`` file.

- Added ``GetTransformMatrix`` function
    Gets the transformation matrix stored on the device.

- Added ``SaveTransformMatrix`` function
    Saves a transformation matrix to the device.

Studio New Features
---------------------
- CSV Data Saving
    Added the ability to save 3D data with a ``.csv`` extension.

- Point Picking Feature
    Added the point picking feature, allowing users to click on a point in the point cloud to view its coordinates.

- Measure Distance Feature
    Added a measure distance feature, enabling users to measure the distance between two selected points.
    After selecting two points, the following information will be displayed in the console:

    - **Distance**: The straight-line distance between the two selected points.
    - **∆X**: The difference in the X-coordinates of the two points.
    - **∆Y**: The difference in the Y-coordinates of the two points.
    - **∆Z**: The difference in the Z-coordinates of the two points.
    - **∆XY**: The distance difference in the XY plane.
    - **∆XZ**: The distance difference in the XZ plane.
    - **∆YZ**: The distance difference in the YZ plane.

- Pick Three Points Feature
    Added the capability to select three points in the 3D view to perform plane correction.

    This feature allows users to select three points in the 3D view to define a plane, align the point cloud, and verify the ``transformation matrix`` used for this alignment.

- Transformation Matrix Management
    Added support for the ``GetTransformMatrix`` and ``SaveTransformMatrix`` API functions in the Studio GUI.
    Users can now retrieve and save transformation matrices directly from the Studio, allowing for easy configuration and alignment adjustments.
    After saving a transformation matrix, users are prompted to reset the Output Mode to apply the changes.
