API Fixed Issues
----------------
- Resolved a conflict between winerror.h and the Swing3D API's ErrorType.
    To avoid conflicts with `ERROR_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED` in winerror.h,
    prefixed all ErrCodes in the Swing3D API with `SWING3D_`.


API New Features
---------------------
- Added ``DeviceSettings::LaserPosition`` class.
    Enables control of the laser position on connected Swing3D devices using ``DeviceSettings::LaserPosition``.

- Added a ``void*`` parameter to the ``CallBackDisconnect`` function for enhanced callback handling.


Studio Fixed Issues
---------------------
- Fixed an issue where the Select Sensor dialog did not properly handle the results of the Force IP Send command.
